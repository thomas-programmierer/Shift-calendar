<h2>How does this app works ?</h2>
<p>This app uses your local storage to save data. The data is not saveon the server. The only one that can see
  the shifts is the one who has access to your computer.<br> <br>
  To add a shift on the button add an shift on top. Or you can click on anytable cell and click add shift to add a shift on that time. And the register the name, description, hour, day
  and expend time. The description is not required.
  <br><br>The expend time is how many hours in additional someone wilwork. If you leave at zero it means that
  the
  shift will be just one hour. If you leave it at two it means the shift will be three hours.
  <br>And you can pick the color of your shift</p>
